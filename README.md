problem sets

NOTE: I used [the following template](http://jenpan.com/resources/) from Jennifer Pan's site as the basis for the problem set document.
This LaTeX template does not appear with an explicit license, but given the context in which it is presented, I think it is reasonable
to assume that other people may use it freely.

The license I have attached to this repository covers my solutions only.
